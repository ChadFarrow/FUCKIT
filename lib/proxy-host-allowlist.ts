/**
 * Keeps the media proxies from being an open internet proxy.
 *
 * /api/proxy-image, /api/proxy-audio and /api/proxy-video take a caller-supplied
 * `?url=` and fetch it. Their only check was isSafePublicUrl (lib/url-security.ts),
 * which blocks PRIVATE addresses — the SSRF question — and permits every public
 * host on the internet. So a stranger could pipe any file anywhere through this
 * deployment's bandwidth and CPU. That is unrelated to any fork; it is open to
 * anyone who knows the URL shape.
 *
 * WHY NOT SIGNED URLS. The obvious fix is an HMAC of the url, keyed by
 * SESSION_SECRET, which only our server could mint. It cannot work here: every
 * proxy URL is built in the BROWSER — lib/cdn-utils.ts, components/CDNImage.tsx
 * ('use client'), lib/audio-url-utils.ts and AudioContext's getAudioUrlsToTry —
 * from artwork and audio URLs that arrive in API responses. The client holds no
 * secret, so signing would mean signing inside every API response instead, which
 * changes their shape (an API_VERSION bump, and the same field is read from many
 * places here) and would strand every proxy URL already cached in a service
 * worker or an offline download.
 *
 * So bind the proxy to the CATALOG instead of to a signature: allow a target host
 * only if it is a host this catalog actually references. That needs no client
 * change, no response-shape change, and nothing already stored goes stale — a
 * saved album's artwork URL still points at a host that is still in the catalog.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, and it is deliberate: a stranger can still proxy some OTHER file on a
 * host we already carry (any file on wavlake.com, say). Closing that would need
 * per-URL state we do not have. The abuse being closed is "proxy anything on the
 * internet", which this ends completely.
 *
 * FAILS OPEN on any database trouble. A proxy that refuses artwork because a
 * query timed out would break the catalog for real users, which costs far more
 * than the abuse does.

 * catalog does not, on its own, cover what the playlists ask it to fetch.
