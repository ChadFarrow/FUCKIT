# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add Support for Podcasting 2.0 Image Tag
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate and implement support for the Podcasting 2.0 image tag specification
# Details:
Research and implement support for the Podcasting 2.0 image tag specification. This involves updating the RSS parser to handle the new image tag format, implementing proper image fallback mechanisms, and ensuring compatibility with existing podcast feeds. The Podcasting 2.0 image tag provides better image handling and metadata for podcast episodes.

# Test Strategy:
Test with feeds that use Podcasting 2.0 image tags, verify proper image parsing and display, test fallback mechanisms for feeds without the new tags, and ensure backward compatibility with existing RSS feeds.
