# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add Passphrase-Protected Feed Addition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a secure way to add new RSS feeds to the site using a passphrase
# Details:
Create a secure system for adding new RSS feeds to the DoerfelVerse site that requires a passphrase. This involves creating an admin interface or API endpoint that validates a passphrase before allowing feed addition, implementing proper security measures to prevent unauthorized feed additions, and ensuring the system is user-friendly while maintaining security.

# Test Strategy:
Test passphrase validation, verify unauthorized access is blocked, test feed addition workflow, ensure proper error handling, and verify the system works across different user scenarios.
