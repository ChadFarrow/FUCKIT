# Music Track Extraction Feature PRD

## Overview
Enhance the RSS feed checker to identify, extract, and organize music tracks from podcast RSS feeds, specifically designed to work with music-focused podcasts like the Doerfel-Verse feed.

## Problem Statement
Current RSS feed checkers only parse basic episode information but don't specifically identify and extract music tracks embedded within podcast episodes. Music podcasts often contain:
- Multiple music tracks within single episodes
- Value-for-value music sharing with timestamps
- Links to external music feeds
- Chapter-based music track organization

## Goals
1. **Track Identification**: Automatically detect music tracks within podcast episodes
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract track titles, artists, timestamps, and duration
3. **Music Feed Discovery**: Find and parse related music-only RSS feeds
4. **Value-for-Value Integration**: Support Lightning Network value-for-value music sharing
5. **User Interface**: Display music tracks in an organized, searchable interface

## Target Users
- Music podcast listeners
- Independent musicians and podcasters
- Music discovery enthusiasts
- Value-for-value podcast supporters

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **RSS Feed Analysis**
   - Parse podcast RSS feeds for music-related metadata
   - Extract chapter information from JSON chapter files
   - Identify value time splits for music sharing
   - Parse podcast roll for related music feeds

2. **Music Track Detection**
   - Analyze episode descriptions for music track mentions
   - Extract timestamps from chapter data
   - Identify value-for-value music segments
   - Parse external music feed links

3. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Track title and artist information
   - Start/end timestamps within episodes
   - Duration and audio quality information
   - Value-for-value payment details
   - External links and references

4. **Feed Discovery**
   - Follow podcast roll links to music feeds
   - Parse related music-only RSS feeds
   - Aggregate music content across multiple feeds
   - Maintain feed relationships and hierarchies

### Data Models
```typescript
interface MusicTrack {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  episodeId: string;
  episodeTitle: string;
  startTime: number; // seconds
  endTime: number; // seconds
  duration: number; // seconds
  audioUrl?: string;
  valueForValue?: {
    lightningAddress: string;
    suggestedAmount: number;
    customKey?: string;
    customValue?: string;
  };
  source: 'chapter' | 'value-split' | 'description' | 'external-feed';
  feedUrl: string;
  discoveredAt: Date;
}

interface MusicFeed {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  feedUrl: string;
  parentFeedUrl?: string;
  relationship: 'podcast-roll' | 'value-split' | 'related';
  tracks: MusicTrack[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

### API Endpoints
1. `GET /api/music-tracks?feedUrl={url}` - Extract music tracks from a feed
2. `GET /api/music-feeds?feedUrl={url}` - Discover related music feeds
3. `GET /api/music-tracks/search?q={query}` - Search across all discovered tracks
4. `POST /api/music-tracks/analyze` - Analyze multiple feeds for music content

### User Interface
1. **Music Track List View**
   - Grid/list view of discovered music tracks
   - Filtering by artist, episode, feed, or source
   - Sorting by date, duration, or popularity
   - Search functionality

2. **Track Detail View**
   - Full track metadata display
   - Audio player integration
   - Value-for-value payment interface
   - Related tracks and feeds

3. **Feed Analysis Dashboard**
   - Music content statistics
   - Feed relationship visualization
   - Discovery timeline
   - Export functionality
