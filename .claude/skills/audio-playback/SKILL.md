# audio-playback

Playback state, track transitions and background audio. Payments triggered by playback (AutoBoost) live in `lightning-boost`; native Android keep-alive lives in `android-native`.

## Tests for this subsystem

```
npx tsx --test lib/playback-state.test.ts           # resume-where-you-left-off: session/position records
npx tsx --test lib/album-rewind.test.ts             # end-of-album rewind index (skips unavailable tracks)
```

## End of Album — rewind the media, not just the index (`contexts/AudioContext.tsx`)
When an album finishes with repeat off, `playNextTrack` rewinds to the first **available** track (`resolveAlbumRewindIndex`, `lib/album-rewind.ts`; tests: `npx tsx --test lib/album-rewind.test.ts`) and cues it **paused at 0:00** via `cueTrackPaused`. The branch used to be `setIsPlaying(false); setCurrentTrackIndex(0);` and nothing else, which produced four distinct bugs — every one of them a consequence of moving state without moving the media.

- **There is no `currentTrack` in the context.** `GlobalNowPlayingBar`, `NowPlayingScreen` and `RadioPlayer` each independently derive `currentPlayingAlbum.tracks[currentTrackIndex]`, so the displayed title is a pure function of the index and is *not* tied to `audioElement.src`. Only `playAlbum` normally keeps the two in step. **Any new code path that moves `currentTrackIndex` must move the media too** — that decoupling is the whole bug family.
- **`setIsPlaying(false)` does not pause anything.** It is React state; the element keeps playing. Skipping past the last track kept the previous song audible while the UI showed track 1. Pause the element explicitly (both of them — see the ping-pong section).
- **`cueTrackPaused` is deliberately not `playAlbum`.** `playAlbum` autoplays, sets `hasUserInteracted`, clears `userInitiatedPauseRef`, flips shuffle off, runs the seamless/ping-pong transition and toasts through the offline gate. The cue does a bare `src` + `load()` into the **active** element (never repoint `activeAudioRef` — that is the ping-pong promotion's job alone). **Every failure path leaves the element empty on purpose**, so `resume()`'s `hasUsableSrc` check reads false and the next tap cold-starts through `playAlbum`.
- **`albumCompleteRef` exists because the visibility net would otherwise start track 2.** The element stays `ended` after an album finishes (`handlePause` swallows the pause that accompanies an end), so the foreground-return net at the top of the file re-entered `playNextTrack` — which, post-rewind, advances from index 0 to **track 2, unprompted, on every app switch**. A successful cue clears `ended` by itself; the ref covers the paths where the cue leaves the element empty. Do **not** overload `trackEndProcessedRef` for this — it is a per-track double-advance guard with three writers. Clear `albumCompleteRef` at all six restart sites (`playAlbum`, `playShuffledTrack`, `playTrack`, `resume`, `stop`, `handlePlay`).
- **`userInitiatedPauseRef.current = true` at album end is load-bearing.** The net's *second* branch auto-resumes anything `paused && src && !userInitiatedPause` — after the cue all three hold, so without it an app switch auto-plays track 1.
- **`lastNonZeroPositionRef.current = 0` is load-bearing.** `resume()` falls back to it when the element's `currentTime` is ~0, which a freshly cued element always is — leave it and the first tap on play starts track 1 and immediately seeks it to wherever the *last* track ended.
- **`handleError` must not auto-skip when `albumCompleteRef` is set.** A cue has no `play()` promise to fail on, so a dead URL surfaces as an `error` event, and the existing 300ms auto-skip would call `playNextTrack` from the rewound index — the same "track 2 plays unprompted" bug in a new costume. `playbackSessionRef` does not guard it (the error arrives after the cue's own bump).
- **Persistence**: a completed album has no resume point, so the branch deletes `PLAYBACK_POSITION_KEY`. Otherwise the position effect writes the last track's end position next to the rewound index and the next launch restores minutes into the wrong track.
- **Shuffle end-of-playlist does not rewind** — a shuffled queue's "first" item is an artifact of the last shuffle. It stays on the track that just played, but stops for real (pause both elements + the same three ref resets).

## iOS PWA Background Audio (`contexts/AudioContext.tsx`)
Three-layer strategy: (1) preload at 15s before end, (2) proactive timer at 5s before end, (3) visibility change safety net. `trackEndProcessedRef` prevents double-advance. **Critical**: do not auto-resume if user explicitly paused. All three layers sit inside a `nextTrack` existence check, so none of them fire on the last track with repeat off — end of album is reached only via `handleEnded` or a manual/lock-screen Next.

## Android Background Audio — Ping-Pong Dual Element (`contexts/AudioContext.tsx`)
Android (Chrome / "add to home screen" PWA) drops `play()` when a track transition does `src=…; load(); play()` on the **same** `<audio>` element while the screen is locked — the `.load()` tears the element down and the follow-up `play()` counts as a fresh background autoplay, which Android blocks. Symptom: music stalls at every track boundary until the user wakes/foregrounds the phone (the visibility safety net was the only recovery). iOS is unaffected — it *relies* on the single-element seamless src-swap to keep its audio session warm.

Fix = **start the next track on a second `<audio>` element while the first is still playing**, then swap active + pause the old one — playback never fully stops, so Android doesn't block it. **Android-gated; iOS/desktop keep the single-element path untouched.**

- **Two audio elements**: `audioRef` (`#stablekraft-audio-player`) + `audioRefB` (`#stablekraft-audio-player-b`). `activeAudioRef` points at the current one; **it is only ever repointed inside the Android ping-pong branch**, so on iOS/desktop `getActiveAudioEl()` always === `audioRef.current`.
- **`getActiveAudioEl()` / `getIdleAudioEl()`** are the indirection. **Every "current playback element" access must go through `getActiveAudioEl()`** (never raw `audioRef.current`) — pause/resume/seek/stall-detection/media-session/NIP-38/visibility-safety-net all do. The media-session `seekto` handler and `stop()` were the easy-to-miss ones (`stop()` pauses **both** audio elements).
- **Listener guard**: media event listeners bind to **both** audio elements; each handler early-returns via `shouldProcess(e)` unless `e.currentTarget` is the true current element (`getActiveAudioEl()`, or the video el in video mode). Without this the idle element's preload events (`loadedmetadata`, etc.) would drive state — e.g. seek the active element to `startTime`.
- **Preload**: at 5s the cross-element preload targets `getIdleAudioEl()` on Android audio→audio (previously a no-op since `nextElement === currentElement`); `attemptPingPongPlayback` reuses it if `readyState >= 2`.
- **Transition path**: `attemptPingPongPlayback(track, album, sessionId)` runs **before** `attemptSeamlessPlayback` in both `playAlbum` and `playShuffledTrack`, gated `isAndroidRef.current && !isVideoMode`. Audio-only (returns false for video/HLS → falls through). On failure it falls through to the existing seamless/full path (no regression). A platform-neutral stopgap (reassert `playbackState='playing'` + one `NotAllowedError` retry, no second `load()`) also lives in `attemptSeamlessPlayback`.
- **Promotion must adopt the new element's clock** (issue #166). `handleLoadedMetadata` is gated by `shouldProcess()`, which rejects events from an element while it is idle — and the incoming element is *always* idle when its metadata arrives, in both the preloaded and the fresh-`load()` path. So the promotion in `attemptPingPongPlayback` explicitly `setDuration(idle.duration)` + syncs `currentTime`/`currentTimeRef`, and a **`durationchange` listener** (bound to both audio elements + video, same `shouldProcess` guard) self-heals metadata that resolves after the swap. Without these, `duration` stays pinned to the *previous* track for the whole song — the time label reads wrong and the progress knob slides off screen. Symptom on device: elapsed exceeding total (e.g. `1:31 / 1:20`).
- **Clamp anything derived from `duration`.** `progress = (currentTime / duration) * 100` drives both the fill width and the knob's `left`, so an over-100% value translates the knob off the right edge. Clamped in `NowPlayingScreen`, `RadioPlayer`, `DatabaseMusicPlayer`. `navigator.mediaSession.setPositionState` reads `currentElement.duration` directly and was never affected — only React state.
- **Verification is device-only**: the locked-screen autoplay policy does not reproduce on desktop/emulator. Test on a physical Android phone + Bluetooth earbuds, screen locked, ≥3 auto boundaries untouched; watch logs for `✅ Ping-pong transition succeeded` and no background `NotAllowedError`.

## VTS (Value Time Splits) Playback (`components/NowPlayingScreen.tsx`)
VTS podcasts embed `<podcast:valueTimeSplit>` segments mapping time ranges to different tracks/artists. Features: chapter tick marks on progress bar, per-song favoriting via `remoteItem`, V4V blending (`remotePercentage` splits between song and show recipients, deduped by address, `isHost` flag for grouping). GUID collision detection via `chapterTitle` param to `/api/lightning/value-splits`. When VTS blending produces both song and show recipients, BoostButton shows **Song/Show section headers** sorted track-first.

- **VTS extraction** (`lib/rss-parser-db.ts`): `applyParsedItemFields` applies chapters, VTS, and other parsed fields. **VTS remoteItem interface** (`lib/podcast-types.ts`): `feedGuid`, `itemGuid`, `medium`.
- **XML entity gotcha**: `parseItemV4VFromXML` matches titles against raw XML — titles with `&` (encoded as `&amp;`) need both decoded and XML-encoded matching.
- **Chapters fallback**: `fetchChapters()` fetches from `podcast:chapters` URL. If the `reflex.livewire.io` proxy returns 400, it extracts the direct URL from the proxy path (`.../chapters/https://actual-url.json`) and retries.
