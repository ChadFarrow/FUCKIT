## Quick Commands

After adding new music to your database, run these commands to ensure everything is properly processed:

### 🚀 **Main Command (Run Everything)**
```bash

```
**This runs the complete workflow automatically!**

### 🎯 **Individual Commands** (if you need specific steps)
```bash
npm run discover-publishers   # Find new Wavlake publisher feeds
npm run integrate-publishers  # Add publisher info to albums (sidebar integration)
npm run check-artwork         # Check all artwork comprehensively  
npm run fix-artwork          # Fix any album artwork issues
```

### 📱 **Direct Script Execution**
```bash
node scripts/update-music-workflow.js           # Complete workflow
node scripts/discover-wavlake-publisher-feeds.js # Publisher discovery only
node scripts/check-all-artwork-comprehensive.js  # Artwork check only
node scripts/fix-all-album-artwork.js           # Artwork fix only
```

## What the Workflow Does

The `update-music` workflow automatically runs these steps in order:

1. **🔍 Publisher Feed Discovery**
   - Scans all Wavlake albums for publisher feed references
   - Discovers new artist feeds not previously known
   - Updates `publisher-feed-results.json`

2. **🎨 Track Artwork Check**
   - Verifies all individual tracks have artwork
   - Reports any missing track images
   - 100% coverage expected

3. **🖼️ Album Artwork Fix**
   - Checks all album covers against feed sources
   - Updates any incorrect album artwork
   - Ensures albums use proper unified covers

4. **📊 Comprehensive Verification**
   - Final check across albums, publisher feeds, and tracks
   - Reports overall artwork coverage statistics
   - Verifies all 3 levels are properly configured

5. **🔗 Publisher Feed Integration**
   - Links discovered publisher feeds to their albums
   - Adds publisher information to album metadata
   - **Enables publishers to appear in the left sidebar menu**

6. **🔄 Feed Rebuild**
   - Rebuilds parsed feeds from music tracks
   - Ensures data consistency across files
   - Updates album structures
